## From Traditional NLP to Autonomous Agents

### Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an AI-based research automation system.

#### **Milestone 1:** 
- Students build a traditional machine learning and NLP-based research analysis system that processes multiple documents related to a topic, performs text preprocessing, keyword extraction, topic modeling, and basic summarization.

**Features**
- **Extractive Summary**: Summarizes text using the TextRank algorithm.
- **Keywords (TF-IDF)**: Extracts the top relevant keywords and Visualizes them.
- **Topic Modeling (LDA)**: Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify underlying topics.
- **Document Support**: Upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT documents for analysis.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Automatically fetch and analyze topics directly from Wikipedia.

#### **Milestone 2:** 
- The same system is extended into a full agentic AI research assistant that accepts open-ended research queries, autonomously retrieves information from the web, reasons across multiple sources, manages state using LangGraph, and generates structured research reports.

The project emphasizes progression from classical NLP and ML concepts to agentic AI workflows, LLM orchestration, and deployment.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Requirements**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Install dependencies via:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file.
- `src/`: Contains source code for logic.
  - `data_fetcher.py`: Document text extraction and Wikipedia fetching.
  - `nlp_pipeline.py`: NLP processing functions (cleaning, TF-IDF, LDA, TextRank).
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.

- Perform text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Identify key themes and keywords.
- Generate extractive or statistical summaries.
- Display analytical results through a basic UI.

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Inputs & Outputs:** Input: Research topic keywords or uploaded documents. Output: Key terms/themes, Topic clusters, Extractive summary. Optional: Analytical visualizations.
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, Stop-word removal, Lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
- **Modeling:** Topic modeling (LDA) or Clustering (K-Means).
- **Summarization:** Basic Extractive techniques.
- **Evaluation:** Coherence or interpretability measures.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Problem understanding & use-case description.
